## What is a monolith?

* Single-tiered software application where UI and data access code is combined into a **single program** from a **single platform**
  * E.g. Single Java.jar file handling business logic for your entire programme

### Monolith Advantages
* Simple
* Single code base
* Resource efficient

### Monolith Disadvantages
* Hard to enforce as application grows (due to single code base)
* Scaling is a challenge
* Slow to react to customer demand 
* Long release cycles (adding more functionality means checking if other code-bases are impacted)
